# Podsearch

## Overview
For the ISTA 498 Capstone at the University of Arizona we set out to create an application that would transform the way of discovering new podcasts. The way we looked to accomplish this was to create an interactive application similiar to dating websites such as Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge to where the user would have podcast suggested to them based off the given variables and then based off the description and other information about the podcast they could choose to save the podcast or go to the next podcast. 

Next we will layout the process we took to create this application how it is running. 

## Design Overveiew
For this poject we wanted to create a design that wanted to create a logo that demonstrated our application while also using a color scheme that would utimately highlight all of our apps application and useability... 

## Kaggle Data Set
One of the most important variables that we wanted to implement into our application was podcasts that had categories and reviews. For those reasons we decided to use this kaggle dataset which had millions of podcasts with both of those variables. From this data we would choose our podcasts that we wanted to include in our application. It is also updated monthly to ensure that it has the most up to date information.

For the application you need to download the JSON Files for the reviews, categories, and podcasts.
