# Podsearch

## Overview
For the ISTA 498 Capstone at the University of Arizona we set out to create an application that would transform the way of discovering new podcasts. The way we looked to accomplish this was to create an interactive application similiar to dating websites such as Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge to where the user would have podcast suggested to them based off the given variables and then based off the description and other information about the podcast they could choose to save the podcast or go to the next podcast. 

Next we will layout the process we took to create this application how it is running.
