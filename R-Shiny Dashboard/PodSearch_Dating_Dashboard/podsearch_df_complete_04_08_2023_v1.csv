I started my investing journey in 1998 while I owned and operated another successful business. Real estate was originally my side hustle. I invested part-time for about 10 years doing rehabs and picking up a handful of rentals before finally becoming a full-time investor. In 2008 when the market crashed, I became  an ""accidental wholesaler"".  (That was never my plan.)

Today, I help real estate investors create unforgettable brands and marketing plans that work!  

I also help people become an expert in one of the most lucrative niches on the planet, probate investing. I have been the leading probate investing expert for more than a decade, and I can make you an expert too. 

Whether you are a full-time investor or real estate is your “side hustle” for the time being, I can help you take your business to the next level.  If you’re ready to shave years off your learning curve you are definitely in the right place. These podcasts not only bring you information packed interviews, but also tools, tips and a whole lot of “how to” information to help you start or grow a successful real estate investing business.
