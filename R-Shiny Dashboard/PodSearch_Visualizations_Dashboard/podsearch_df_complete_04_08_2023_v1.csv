This podcast with over 3 million downloads is for smart, high-ability ADD/ADHD (diagnosed or suspecting) women who see their symptoms as more positive than negative. If you want to fall in love with your ADHD brain and discover where your brilliance lies, this podcast is for you! 
*
*
ADHD for Smart Ass Women is globally ranked in the top one-half percent of all podcasts in the world on any subject. It's streamed in more than 160 countries and is downloaded by more than 150,000 listeners every month.
*
*
I’m Tracy Otsuka your host. I'm a lawyer, not a doctor, a life-long learner and a certified ADHD coach. I’m committed to changing the conversation around ADHD. 
*
*
When I was diagnosed eight months after my son, my entire life suddenly made perfect sense but all I heard and read about was everything that my ADHD brain SHOULD be struggling with when in fact I would come to learn that my ADHD is responsible for some of my greatest superpowers. 
*
*
One other thing, we constantly hear about all the successful ADHD men, but no one talks about the women. This podcast is here to change that dynamic. ADHD women are my people, and I’m here to acknowledge, support and cheer them on.

Hello world! I'm your host Erica Lippy. 

I'm excited to share this journey with all of you. If you're like me, you are driven, curious, and passionate. We all could use a little inspiration, motivation, and encouragement. 

This podcast was inspired by my constant desire to grow, learn, and evolve as a person and share valuable conversations with others seeking the same. 

The very meaning of this Podcast is to evoke positive change in our lives so that we can become the best version of our authentic self; we then can live our lives more passionately and purposefully.

I'll bring on inspiring guests, some who are professionals in their field, some who are titans of their industry, and others that speak from life experience... meaningful conversations that inspire us to be bold and build our inner landscape. 

This is a place to encourage us to BE and BECOME better daily.

Let's keep this pursuit in action!

Thank you for joining me on this journey, now lets get to it!

Although I can't provide everything travel has to offer through the convenience of your earbuds, what I can do is let you meet people you would never normally met. Meet poets in London, chefs in southern Germany, ghost hunters in Seattle, and an architect in Malaysia. They are all here, and generously share their stories so that we can see a different side of life.

For example, you’ll get chats with TED Talk hotshots like Andy Puddicombe on meditation, experts like Tsh Oxenreider on gratitude, humble influencers like Joshua Becker on minimalism, or Paleo superstars like Mark Sisson on Primal-living. The show has 100,000s of downloads because listeners love to deeply explore the slower side of life, simplicity through mindfulness, and intentional living … among other things. Do you need help with your “stuff,” personal relationships, or your relationship with money? Do you enjoy nerdy riffs about spreadsheets or casual references to 1990s music?

If you are a Type-A planner who wants to parent proactively, we’re here for you. If you find yourself somewhere in between….that parent who longs to parent with intention, but often ends up reacting to situations as they arise, you are our people!

Our distinct philosophy - Future Focused Parenting – takes center stage on the podcast. We open every episode with our own personal “why” to demonstrate bringing intention to specific parenting issues. Then we dive into the “what” and “how” of each topic, moving quickly into actionable tools and strategies our listeners can start using right away.

As your co-hosts, we bring our professional experience to bear, but never fail to share our own struggles as parents. In addition, we have some unique differences in our personalities and beliefs. This dynamic creates a distinct feel, allowing our listeners to explore varying ways to approach parenting topics and ultimately decide what works for their family.

We invite you to listen to the groundbreaking parenting podcast that starts with the end in mind.

I started my investing journey in 1998 while I owned and operated another successful business. Real estate was originally my side hustle. I invested part-time for about 10 years doing rehabs and picking up a handful of rentals before finally becoming a full-time investor. In 2008 when the market crashed, I became  an ""accidental wholesaler"".  (That was never my plan.)

Today, I help real estate investors create unforgettable brands and marketing plans that work!  

I also help people become an expert in one of the most lucrative niches on the planet, probate investing. I have been the leading probate investing expert for more than a decade, and I can make you an expert too. 

Whether you are a full-time investor or real estate is your “side hustle” for the time being, I can help you take your business to the next level.  If you’re ready to shave years off your learning curve you are definitely in the right place. These podcasts not only bring you information packed interviews, but also tools, tips and a whole lot of “how to” information to help you start or grow a successful real estate investing business.
